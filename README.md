# BeamerInbrain
Beamer presentation template for presentations from the InBrain Lab (inbrainlab.com)

Simply clone it and start working on your presentation:

    git clone https://github.com/inbrainlab/BeamerInbrain.git your/folder


This repository includes the following files:

1. `InBrainFrametitle.png` - the lab logo, goes into the frame title of every frame that has one
2. `README.md` - you are reading it right now
3. `beamerthemeinbrain.sty` - the theme definition itself. You can alter it here, or make ammendments on your .tex file
4. `testinbraintheme.pdf` - the result of compiling `testinbraintheme.tex`. Looks a lot like my qualification presentation.
5. `testinbraintheme.tex` - the code used to generate `testinbraintheme.pdf`. I included some example frames so it is easier to learn how to do basic stuff. If you want some more examples, fill an issue in this repository and I will add it.
